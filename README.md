twitterHashtagPull
==================

Pull certain hashtag from twitter.  I created a Node server to access the twitter api using Express.js.  I am using the express-handlerbars templating engine.  On the client side, I am using angular. 

To run (assuming you have node installed):

In terminal type:

npm install

then

node app
